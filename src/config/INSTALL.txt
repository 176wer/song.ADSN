Installing Adit:
1. Unzip or untar all files in the distribution 
3. Make sure your JDBC drivers are in your Java classpath or add the jar files 
    to the lib/ext directory of your JRE
4. Change to the directory created in step 1
5. Start adit by typing: java -jar adit.jar

On Windows you can double click on adit.jar to start Adit

Sample driver and JDBC urls are in the driver.ini and url.ini files included 
with Adit. You can edit these to add your own connection information. 
See your JDBC driver documentation for details on the proper format 
for the url.
